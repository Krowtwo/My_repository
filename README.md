Project Overview
For this project, we will help customers invest their money in stocks. The job is to 
extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various
sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we 
will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla,
Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
